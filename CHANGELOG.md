## [Unreleased]

### Added
- Support for Xcode 12.5
- A Changelog :-)

### Changed
- Swift tests now include trailing parenthesis (e.g. `testSwift()` in their names).
  This will be reflected in the JUnit reports, tracing profiles, etc. If you are parsing the output (you should not!) be aware this might break your scripts.
- Changed the macOS deployment target from 10.13 to 10.15.
- Changed the iOS deployment target we test on from 12.0 to 14.4

### Deprecated

### Removed
- Support for Xcode versions 12.4 and older.

### Fixed

### Security
