Bluepill is a tool to run iOS tests in parallel using multiple simulators.

## Motivation

LinkedIn created Bluepill to run iOS tests in parallel using multiple simulators.

## Features

-  Running tests in parallel by using multiple simulators.
-  Automatically packing tests into groups with similar running time.
-  Running tests in headless mode to reduce memory consumption.
-  Generating a junit report after each test run.
-  Reporting test running stats, including test running speed and environment robustness.
-  Retrying when the Simulator hangs or crashes.

## Usages

It is quick and easy to start using Bluepill! In a simplified scenario, you just need to run the following command and Bluepill will kick off 4 simulators to run your tests in parallel. By the end of the test run, it will generate a report in ./output.

```
./bluepill -a ./Sample.app -s ./SampleAppTestScheme.xcscheme -o ./output/
```

Alternatively, you can have a configuration file like the one below:

```
{
   "app": "./Sample.app", # Relative path or abs path
   "scheme-path": "./SampleAppTestScheme.xcscheme", # Relative path or abs path
   "output-dir": "./build/" # Relative path or abs path
}
```

And run

```
./bluepill -c config.json
```

A full list supported options are listed here.
