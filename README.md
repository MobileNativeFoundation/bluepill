Bluepill is a tool to run iOS tests in parallel using multiple simulators.

## Motivation

LinkedIn created Bluepill to run iOS tests in parallel using multiple simulators.

## Features

-  Running tests in parallel by using multiple simulators.
-  Automatically packing tests into groups with similar running time.
-  Running tests in headless mode to reduce memory consumption.
-  Generating a junit report after each test run.
-  Reporting test running stats, including test running speed and environment robustness.
-  Retrying when the Simulator hangs or crashes.

## Usages

It is quick and easy to start using Bluepill!

- Get bluepill binary: build from source or use our [releases](https://github.com/linkedin/bluepill/releases/).
- Build your app and test bundle. Remember to include `build-for-testing` flag if you use `xcodebuild` in terminal.
- Run!

```
./bluepill -a ./Sample.app -s ./SampleAppTestScheme.xcscheme -o ./output/
```

Alternatively, you can use a configuration file like the one below:

```
{
   "app": "./Sample.app", # Relative path or abs path
   "scheme-path": "./SampleAppTestScheme.xcscheme", # Relative path or abs path
   "output-dir": "./build/" # Relative path or abs path
}
```

And run

```
./bluepill -c config.json
```

## Requirements

Latest Xcode (Xcode 8.2.1).

## Acknowledgement

Bluepill was inspired by [parallel iOS test](https://github.com/plu/parallel_ios_tests) and Facebookâ€™s [xctool](https://github.com/facebook/xctool) and [FBSimulatorControl](https://github.com/facebook/FBSimulatorControl). The Bluepill icon was created by [Maria Iu](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mariaiu/).

## Q & A
- Are we able to run Xcode UI Testing bundle with Bluepill

  _YES_, we recently added support for Xcode UI Testing bundles. Thanks to the inspiration from [FBSimulatorControl](https://github.com/facebook/FBSimulatorControl).

- Easiest way to get Bluepill binary?

  Latest [release](https://github.com/linkedin/bluepill/releases/).

- How to test Bluepill in Xcode

  Select BPSampleApp scheme and build it first. Then you can switch back to `bluepill` or `bluepill-cli` scheme to run their tests.

- How to get Bluepill binary from source?

  Run `./bluepill.sh build` to test and build Bluepill. The binary will be output in the ./build folder.

- How to test my changes to Bluepill?

  Run `./scripts/bluepill.sh test`.
