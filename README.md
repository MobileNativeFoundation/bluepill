Bluepill is a tool to run iOS tests in parallel using multiple simulators.

## Motivation

[LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com) created Bluepill to run its large iOS test suite in a reasonable amount of time. If you want the long story, read [the blog post](https://engineering.linkedin.com/blog/2017/01/open-sourcing-bluepill--run-ios-tests-in-multiple-simulators).

## Features

-  Running tests in parallel by using multiple simulators.
-  Automatically packing tests into groups.
-  Running tests in headless mode to reduce memory consumption.
-  Generating a junit report after each test run.
-  Reporting test running stats, including test running speed and environment robustness.
-  Retrying when the Simulator hangs or crashes.

## Usages

It is quick and easy to start using Bluepill!

- Get bluepill binary: build from source or use our [releases](https://github.com/linkedin/bluepill/releases/). You can also get the binary from Homebrew.

``` shell
$ brew install bluepill
```

- Build your app and test bundle. You must `build-for-testing` if you use `xcodebuild` in terminal.
- Run bluepill using the `.xctestrun` file generated by Xcode.

```shell
$ bluepill --xctestrun-path ./SampleAppTest_iphonesimulator10.3-x86_64.xctestrun -o ./output/
```

Alternatively, you can use a configuration file like the one below:

```
{
   "xctestrun-path": "./SampleAppTest_iphonesimulator10.3-x86_64.xctestrun", # Relative path or abs path
   "output-dir": "./build/" # Relative path or abs path
}
```

And run

```shell
$ bluepill -c config.json
```

## Demo

## Requirements

Bluepill only works with **Xcode 9.1**. If you're looking for old Xcode support, please check out the other branches:

* [Xcode-8](https://github.com/linkedin/bluepill/tree/xcode8)
* [Xcode-9.0](https://github.com/linkedin/bluepill/tree/xcode-9.0)

## Acknowledgement

Bluepill was inspired by [parallel iOS test](https://github.com/plu/parallel_ios_tests) and Facebookâ€™s [xctool](https://github.com/facebook/xctool) and [FBSimulatorControl](https://github.com/facebook/FBSimulatorControl).

## Fastlane Support

If you're using [Fastlane](https://github.com/fastlane/fastlane) to run your tests, you're in luck! You can integrate Bluepill into your project with very little change to your existing setup. Just integrate one of the following Fastlane plugins, and you'll be on your way:

- [Redpill](https://github.com/omniprojects/fastlane-plugin-redpill) - The most up-to-date plugin; it's is maintained by [Omni](https://github.com/omniprojects) and offers a full set of options to hook into Bluepill. As of this writing, Redpill is compiled against Xcode 9.1, and intended for use with [CircleCI](https://circleci.com). It will be updated with newer versions of Xcode when CircleCI supports them.
- [fastlane-plugin-bluepill](https://github.com/tbrand/fastlane-plugin-bluepill) - Last updated Nov. 7th, offers basic support for working with the Bluepill binary.
- [Bluepillar](https://github.com/Shashikant86/fastlane-plugin-bluepillar) - Last updated May 29th, it's the original fastlane plugin for working with Bluepill. It was inspired by [this blog post](https://medium.com/@shashikant.jagtap/running-xcuitests-in-parallel-with-fastlane-and-bluepill-370e8ba90958).

## Q & A
- Are we able to run Xcode UI Testing bundle with Bluepill

  _YES_, we recently added support for Xcode UI Testing bundles. Thanks to the inspiration from [FBSimulatorControl](https://github.com/facebook/FBSimulatorControl). Bluepill now supports Xcode unit test bundle and UI test bundles.

- Easiest way to get Bluepill binary?

  Latest [release](https://github.com/linkedin/bluepill/releases/). 

- How to test Bluepill in Xcode

  Select BPSampleApp scheme and build it first. Then you can switch back to `bluepill` or `bluepill-cli` scheme to run their tests.

- How to get Bluepill binary from source?

  Run `./scripts/bluepill.sh build` to test and build Bluepill. The binary will be output in the ./build folder.

- How to test my changes to Bluepill?

  Run `./scripts/bluepill.sh test`.

- How to BUMP the max files and max procs to support running multiple simulators on macOS?
