Tips for Getting Your Pull Request Accepted
===========================================

1. Make sure all new code are tested and the tests pass.
2. Bug fixes must include a test case demonstrating the error that it fixes.
3. Open an issue first and seek advice for your change before submitting
   a pull request. Large features which have never been discussed are
   unlikely to be accepted. **You have been warned.**
